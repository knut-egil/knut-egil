Software Developer - Doing a bit of everything.
Always jumping down new rabbit holes! Based in Molde, Norway ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´

I like making small but useful apps and devices. Focused on solving problems to improve lives and save time. My main goal is to reduce the time spent doing tedious tasks - and increase quality of life.

I also do some reverse engineering and bug hunting.
